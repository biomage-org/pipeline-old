\title{STEP 3. Mitochondrial content filter}
\usage{
filter_high_mito(
  scdata,
  config,
  sample_id,
  cells_id,
  task_name = "mitochondrialContent",
  num_cells_to_downsample = 6000
)
}
\arguments{
\item{config}{list containing the following information
- enable: true/false. Refering to apply or not the filter.
- auto: true/false. 'True' indicates that the filter setting need to be changed depending on some sensible value (it requires
to call generate_default_values_mitochondrialContent)
- filterSettings: slot with thresholds
- method: String. Method to be used {absoluteThreshold}
- methodSettings: List with the method as key and contain all the filterSettings for this specific method.
* absoluteThreshold: based on a cut-off threshold
- maxFraction: Float. maximun pct MT-content that we considere for a alive cell
- binStep: Float. Bin size for the histogram
* we are supposed to add more methods ....}
}
\value{
a list with the filtered seurat object by mitochondrial content, the config and the plot values
}
\description{
This is a simplest filter that looks at a threshold value for the mitochondrial content.
}
\details{
To separate cells with low MT-content from the ones that have a high MT-content what makes us think that are dead.
This can be a useful first guess. The settings for such a filter can also contain a simple "probabilityThreshold" setting.
